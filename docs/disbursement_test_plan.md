# Disbursement Form Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the test plan for the new DisbursementForm component implementation. The tests are designed to verify that the new implementation maintains all the functionality of the original component while leveraging the new utility functions for improved performance and maintainability.

## Test Cases

  - Valid multipliers should be accepted
  - Invalid multipliers should show an error
  - The total quantity should update correctly based on the multiplier

### 4. Stock Change Calculation

- **Test ID**: DISB-TEST-004
- **Description**: Verify that stock change is calculated correctly
- **Steps**:
  1. Render the component with initial disbursements
  2. Modify a disbursement's multiplier
  3. Add a new disbursement for the same medication
  4. Mark a disbursement for deletion
- **Expected Results**: 
  - Stock change should reflect the total impact on inventory
  - Deleted disbursements should not affect stock change
  - Stock change should account for original values in edit mode

### 5. Add/Remove Disbursements

- **Test ID**: DISB-TEST-005
- **Description**: Verify that disbursements can be added and removed
- **Steps**:
  1. Render the component
  2. Add a new disbursement
  3. Remove a disbursement without an ID
  4. Mark a disbursement with an ID for deletion
  5. Restore a deleted disbursement
- **Expected Results**: 
  - New disbursements should be added to the list
  - Disbursements without IDs should be removed completely
  - Disbursements with IDs should be marked for deletion
  - Deleted disbursements should be restorable

### 6. Form Submission

- **Test ID**: DISB-TEST-006
- **Description**: Verify that the form can be submitted correctly
- **Steps**:
  1. Render the component in pharmacy mode
  2. Complete all disbursements
  3. Click the "Complete Disbursement" button
  4. Confirm the disbursement
- **Expected Results**: 
  - Confirmation dialog should appear
  - onDisbursementComplete callback should be called
  - Dialog should close after confirmation

### 7. Parent Component Integration

- **Test ID**: DISB-TEST-007
- **Description**: Verify that the component integrates correctly with parent components
- **Steps**:
  1. Render the component with a parent component
  2. Make changes to disbursements
  3. Call resetLocalState method
- **Expected Results**: 
  - onDisbursementsChange callback should be called with updated disbursements
  - resetLocalState should reset the component to its initial state

### 8. Error Handling

- **Test ID**: DISB-TEST-008
- **Description**: Verify that errors are handled correctly
- **Steps**:
  1. Render the component
  2. Simulate an error loading medications
  3. Enter invalid multiplier values
  4. Try to exceed available stock
- **Expected Results**: 
  - Error messages should be displayed
  - Form validation should prevent submission with invalid data
  - Stock exceedance should be highlighted

## Integration Tests

### 1. Database Integration

- **Test ID**: DISB-INT-001
- **Description**: Verify that the component interacts correctly with the database
- **Steps**:
  1. Render the component with real database connection
  2. Add, modify, and delete disbursements
  3. Submit the form
- **Expected Results**: 
  - Database should be updated correctly
  - Stock levels should be adjusted appropriately
  - Disbursement records should be created/updated/deleted as expected

### 2. UI Integration

- **Test ID**: DISB-INT-002
- **Description**: Verify that the component integrates correctly with the UI
- **Steps**:
  1. Navigate to the disbursement page
  2. Perform various operations (add, modify, delete disbursements)
  3. Submit the form
- **Expected Results**: 
  - UI should update correctly
  - Navigation should work as expected
  - Form submission should update the UI state

## Performance Tests

### 1. Large Dataset Handling

- **Test ID**: DISB-PERF-001
- **Description**: Verify that the component performs well with large datasets
- **Steps**:
  1. Render the component with a large number of medications
  2. Add many disbursements
  3. Perform various operations
- **Expected Results**: 
  - Component should remain responsive
  - Calculations should be performed efficiently
  - No significant performance degradation

## Comparison with Original Implementation

For each test case, compare the results with the original implementation to ensure that the new implementation maintains all functionality while improving performance and maintainability.
